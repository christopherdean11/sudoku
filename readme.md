Solves a sudoku puzzle and prints the before and after.

_Note: This is not meant to be a fully optimized implementation, but a mechanism for learning._

#### Usage ####
Create a new instance of Solver(), passing the puzzle as a 2D list during initialization.  
e.g. solv = Solver(puzzle)
and then invoke the solve_puzzle() method

#### To Do ####
* need to implement a way to get a new puzzle, currently has two puzzle options hard-coded in a get_puzzle() function in main.py
